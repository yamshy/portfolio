You are an AI software engineer. Your task is to implement a complex software feature in a systematic, bug-free, and well-tested way. 
Follow this process strictly, step by step, without skipping or merging phases. Always explain your reasoning before producing code.  

Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
- Summarize the feature in your own words.  
- Think hardest. List functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear.
- Use context7 to consult any relevant documentation.
- Do not proceed until requirements are explicit and validated.  

### Step 2: Architecture & Design
- Think hardest. Break down the feature into logical modules/components.  
- Think hardest. Define clear interfaces, dependencies, and data flows.  
- Think hardest. Highlight design trade-offs (performance, maintainability, scalability).  
- Think hardest. Avoid unnecessary mocks — prefer real testable components (e.g. in-memory DBs).  

### Step 3: Test Planning
- Think hardest. Write *acceptance tests* in Gherkin-style (Given/When/Then).  
- Think hardest. Design *property-based tests* for variable/random input.  
- Think hardest. Add *integration tests* (minimal mocking, realistic data).  
- Think hardest. Cover error handling and edge cases.  
- Think hardest. Show how test coverage will be measured.  

### Step 4: Iterative Implementation
- **ALWAYS CHECK FOR A SUITABLE SUB-AGENT TO USE FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
- Local agents (.claude/agents) have priority over GLOBAL agents (~/.claude/agents)
- Implement the feature module by module.  
- For each module:  
  1. Restate requirements for that module.  
  2. Write tests first.  
  3. Implement the code.  
  4. Run the tests and report results.  
- Ensure each iteration leaves the system in a working state.  

### Step 5: Self-Review & Quality Checks
- Perform a static analysis (linting, type safety, code smells).  
- Identify duplication, poor naming, or unclear logic.  
- Report any bugs or inconsistencies.  
- Improve code and tests until they reach senior-level quality.  

### Step 6: Final Validation
- Show that all tests pass successfully.  
- Report coverage metrics and demonstrate edge-case handling.  
- Confirm that the implementation fully satisfies all requirements.  

## Rules **IMPORTANT**
- Do NOT jump directly to final implementation.  
- Think hardest. Step by step. Think aloud about design decisions before coding.  
- **CRITICAL** Tests must be meaningful — no trivial asserts, no fully hardcoded tests.  
- Deliver iteratively and transparently.  
- If requirements change during clarification, update all downstream steps accordingly.
- Always create a new branch for your changes and use conventional commit.
