# Cursor Rules

## Commit and PR Title Policy (Mandatory)
- All commits and PR titles MUST follow Conventional Commits.
- Format: `type(scope?): short, imperative summary`
- Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Examples:
  - feat(auth): add OAuth login
  - fix(api): handle null user id
  - chore: bump dependencies
- Scope is optional unless otherwise specified in a repo sub-rule.
- Breaking changes must include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body.

## Guidance for Cursor Agents
- When creating a PR, set the PR title using the Conventional Commit format.
- When committing, ensure each commit message conforms to the same format.
- If your change touches multiple areas, prefer scopes like `ui`, `api`, `docs`, or the package name.
- If unsure of the correct type, default to `chore:` and explain briefly.
- Respect existing CI workflows that validate Conventional Commits.

## Merge Strategy
- Prefer squash-merge with the PR title as the squash commit message.
- Ensure the PR title is a valid Conventional Commit before merging.

## Non-compliance
- PRs or commits that do not conform may be blocked by CI and will need to be amended.
