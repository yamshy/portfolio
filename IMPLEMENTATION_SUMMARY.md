# Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Project Setup
- ✅ Added semantic-release and required plugins to `package.json`:
  - `@semantic-release/changelog` - Generates CHANGELOG.md
  - `@semantic-release/git` - Commits version changes
  - `@semantic-release/github` - Creates GitHub releases
  - `@semantic-release/npm` - Bumps version (no publish)
  - `semantic-release` - Core package
- ✅ Added `pnpm release` script for local testing

### 2. Release Configuration
- ✅ Created `release.config.js` with ES module format
- ✅ Configured for conventional commits analysis
- ✅ Set up changelog generation
- ✅ Configured Git commits and GitHub releases
- ✅ Set to run on `main` branch only

### 3. Docker Configuration
- ✅ Created multi-stage `Dockerfile`:
  - Node 20 Alpine builder stage
  - Caddy minimal static server final stage
  - Non-root user execution
  - Port 8080 exposed (for non-root compatibility)
- ✅ Created `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
  - Triggers on push to main
  - Uses `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v4` for reliable outputs
  - Installs dependencies with pnpm
  - Runs semantic-release with proper plugin configuration
  - **Gates Docker image build on actual releases only**
  - Builds and pushes Docker image to GHCR
  - Tags images with semantic versions
  - Adds OCI labels for provenance

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with:
  - Conventional commits format explanation
  - Release process documentation
  - Container image information (including port 8080)
  - Deployment notes
- ✅ Created initial `CHANGELOG.md`

## 🔧 What You Need to Configure

### 1. Update Repository URL
In `release.config.js`, replace the placeholder:
```js
repositoryUrl: "https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>"
```
With your actual repository URL:
```js
repositoryUrl: "https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name"
```

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup
- Ensure your repository has the `main` branch (or update the config if using `master`)
- Verify GitHub Actions are enabled in your repository settings
- Ensure the repository has the necessary permissions for:
  - Contents: write (for releases and tags)
  - Packages: write (for GHCR)

### 3. First Release
To trigger your first release:
1. Make a commit with a conventional commit message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initial portfolio setup"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Run semantic-release using the maintained action
   - Create version 1.0.0
   - Generate CHANGELOG.md
   - Create a GitHub release
   - **Only if a release is published**: Build and push Docker image to GHCR

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Commit Message Analysis**: semantic-release analyzes your commit messages using conventional commits
2. **Version Determination**: Automatically determines the next semantic version
3. **Release Creation**: Creates Git tags, updates CHANGELOG.md, and publishes GitHub releases
4. **Conditional Container Build**: **Only builds/pushes Docker images when a new release is actually published**
5. **Container Publishing**: GitHub Actions builds a Docker image and pushes it to GHCR
6. **Image Tagging**: Images are tagged with semantic versions (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`)
7. **OCI Labels**: Images include provenance information for security and traceability

## 📋 Commit Message Examples

- `feat: add new portfolio section` → Minor version bump
- `fix: resolve responsive layout issue` → Patch version bump
- `BREAKING CHANGE: redesign navigation structure` → Major version bump
- `docs: update README` → No version bump
- `chore: update dependencies` → No version bump

## 🔍 Testing Locally

You can test the semantic-release configuration locally:
```bash
pnpm release --dry-run
```

Note: This will fail on repository access in a local environment, but it will verify that all plugins load correctly.

## 🐳 Container Images

Images will be published to:
- `ghcr.io/<owner>/portfolio:<version>` (e.g., `ghcr.io/username/portfolio:1.0.0`)
- `ghcr.io/<owner>/portfolio:latest`

**Important**: Images are only built and pushed when semantic-release actually publishes a new release. This prevents unnecessary image builds for non-releasable commits.

**Port Configuration**: Container exposes port 8080 for non-root user compatibility, making it suitable for Kubernetes deployments.

## 🔗 Next Steps

1. Update the repository URL in `release.config.js`
2. Push your changes to GitHub
3. Make your first conventional commit to trigger a release
4. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow execution
5. Verify the container image is published to GHCR

## 🎯 Key Improvements Made

- **Reliable Version Outputs**: Uses `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v4` for proper step outputs
- **Gated Image Builds**: Only builds Docker images when releases are actually published
- **Non-root Compatibility**: Container runs on port 8080 for better security
- **Consistent Package Manager**: Uses pnpm throughout the workflow
- **Clean Configuration**: Optimized release.config.js with concise plugin definitions

Your Astro portfolio is now set up with rock-solid automated semantic versioning and container image publishing! 🎉
